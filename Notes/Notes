1) The scevo build script accepts a few options :

    --no-renv     : build without using renv (doesn't currently work ... )
    --dont-deploy : dont actualy deploy the packages to a docker yet.

2) rgdal is not in cran any more, but can be fetched from :
       https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/2023-04-20/
   using
       install.packages("rgdal", repos="https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/2023-04-20/")

3) Interesting observation.  Often the build with renv fails because the package "foreign"
   is not found, even though it was explicitly added in the build_dash_renv.rs file.
   Usually just running the script again resolves the issue.

4) posit.co is the default location for packages used by rocker/r-ver - this may explain 
   point 3 above in that at least one package failed when trying to fetch from there, but it 
   is curious that it then works the second time.

5) using rocker/r-ver:4.3.2 in the fails with "unable to translate '...' to a wide string"
   This, it turns out is the newer version of R :

      R 4.3.0 changelog says: "Regular expression functions now check more thoroughly
      whether their inputs are valid strings (in their encoding, e.g. in UTF-8)."

   see:

6) if you are using this in shinyproxy an example config is included

7) Changing shinyproxy config ( sudo vi /etc/shinyproxy/application.yml ) will
   require a restart of shinyproxy server :

      sudo service shinyproxy restart

   and then there is a significant delay before it becomes usable.  Check
   using :

      sudo service shinyproxy status
